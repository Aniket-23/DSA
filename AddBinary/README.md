# Binary String Sum

This project contains a solution to add two binary strings and return their sum as a binary string.

## Problem Statement

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

### Example 1

**Input:**
```plaintext
a = "11"
b = "1"
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
"100"
```

### Example 2

**Input:**
```plaintext
a = "1010"
b = "1011"
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
"10101"
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
- `a` and `b` consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
